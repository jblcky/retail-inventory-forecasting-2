  - 🎓 School holidays
- Improves demand accuracy using **real-world temporal features**.

### ✅ Expiry Management Module
- Auto-detect SKUs nearing expiry.
- Suggest redistribution:
  - To outlets with faster turnover.
  - Or to e-commerce with broader reach.
- Reduce **expired stock losses**.

### ✅ Explainable AI (XAI)

- Transparent forecasting trusted by business users.

### ✅ Outlier Detection Layer
- Flag anomalies like:
  - Panic buying
  - Unexpected stockpiling
