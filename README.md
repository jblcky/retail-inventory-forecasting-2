# 🛍️ Retail Inventory Optimization Suite (Future-Proof, End-to-End)

**Forecast demand. Prevent stockouts. Minimize waste. Maximize revenue.**

This is a **realistic, production-ready inventory optimization project** designed for the retail sector. It goes beyond traditional forecasting by incorporating **expiry-aware redistribution**, **event-aware seasonality**, **explainable AI**, and **future-proof modular design** — all built using **free cloud platforms** like Google Colab and GitHub.

## 🚀 Highlights

### ✅ Multi-Objective Inventory Optimization
- Forecast **store-SKU demand** to prevent stockouts.
- Maintain **minimal inventory** without hurting sales.
- Redistribute **short-dated inventory** to the best-suited outlets or online store.

### ✅ Event- and Seasonality-Aware Forecasting
- Incorporates:
  - 🎄 Public holidays
  - 🦠 Flu/COVID waves
  - 🎓 School holidays
  - 🌧️ Weather events *(future extension)*
  - 💰 Promotional events *(future extension)*

### ✅ Expiry Management Module
- Auto-detect SKUs nearing expiry.
- Suggest redistribution:
  - To outlets with faster turnover.
  - Or to e-commerce with broader reach.
- Reduce **expired stock losses**.

### ✅ Explainable AI (XAI)
- Use SHAP to explain **why** demand goes up or down.
- Transparent forecasting trusted by business users.

### ✅ Outlier Detection Layer
- Flag anomalies like:
  - Panic buying
  - Unexpected stockpiling
  - Promotions
- Business can act or exclude them from training.

### ✅ Auto-Redeployment & Retraining Hooks
- Modular pipeline supports:
  - Scheduled retraining
  - Trigger-based retraining when performance drops

### ✅ Streamlit Dashboard (Optional)
- Clean UI for:
  - Demand visualization
  - Expiry alerts
  - Redistribution suggestions
- Useful for non-technical stakeholders.
